Welcome to the Zodiac GX firmware source code.

To build your own Zodiac GX firmware you will need to have access to a Linux, BSD or MacOSX system (case-sensitive filesystem required). Cygwin will not be supported because of the lack of case sensitiveness in the file system.
For information on setting up your computer and installing the required tools to build an OpenWRT image please refer the OpenWRT website.

Clone the repository to your local computer
In the root directory run "./scripts/feeds update -a" to get all the latest package definitions
Run "./scripts/feeds install -a" to install symlinks of all of them into /package/feeds/.
Copy OpenvSwitch patch "0099-manufacturer-desc.patch" to the directory /feeds/packages/net/openvswitch/patches/
Remove the line "CONFIGURE_ARGS += --disable-ssl" from the Makefile in the directory /feeds/packages/net/openvswitch/
Copy the ZodiacGX_config file to .config
Update build dependencies by running "make defconfig"

Add or remove applications if required using "make menuconfig"

Simply running "make" will build your firmware.
It will download all sources, build the cross-compile toolchain, the kernel and all choosen applications.
When the compilation is complete the resulting fimrware will be called "lede-ramips-mt7621-zodiac-gx-squashfs-sysupgrade.bin" and be in /bin/targets/ramips/mt7621 directory.
